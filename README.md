# SoftwareEngineeringAssignment
This Repo is our college assignment of course Software Engineering and the goal is to make or take a mini project and implement TDD(Test Driven Development) and CI/CD(Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment).

We would like to brief up on what the actual process of TDD and CI/CD looks like : 

TDD ->

Test Driven Development is the process in which test cases are written before the code that validates those cases. It depends on repetition of a very short development cycle. Test driven Development is a technique in which automated Unit test are used to drive the design and free decoupling of dependencies.

It's a cycle of 3 process which are : 
-> Red – Create a test case and make it fail
-> Green – Make the test case pass by any means.
-> Refactor – Change the code to remove duplicate/redundancy.

CI/CD ->

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams (AKA "integration hell").

Continuous Integration refers to the practice of frequently integrating code changes from developers into a shared repository, where automated tests are run to catch potential issues early on in the development cycle. This helps to reduce the risk of conflicts and allows developers to catch and fix issues quickly.

Continuous Delivery/Deployment is the process of automating the release of software to production environments. With Continuous Delivery, the code is automatically built, tested, and deployed to a staging environment, where it is then reviewed before being released to production. Continuous Deployment takes this process one step further by automatically deploying the code to production once it has been successfully tested in the staging environment.

Together, CI/CD helps software teams to reduce the time it takes to deliver new features and bug fixes to users, improve the quality and reliability of software releases, and increase the overall efficiency and productivity of the development process.
