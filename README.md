# SoftwareEngineeringAssignment
This Repo is our college assignment of course Software Engineering and the goal is to make or take a mini project and implement TDD(Test Driven Development) and CI/CD(Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment).

We would be adding our basic test cases and check if they pass first ! 

We would like to brief up on what the actual process of TDD and CI/CD looks like : 

Test Driven Development is the process in which test cases are written before the code that validates those cases. It depends on repetition of a very short development cycle. Test driven Development is a technique in which automated Unit test are used to drive the design and free decoupling of dependencies.

It's a cycle of 3 process which are : 
-> Red – Create a test case and make it fail
-> Green – Make the test case pass by any means.
-> Refactor – Change the code to remove duplicate/redundancy.

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams (AKA "integration hell").
